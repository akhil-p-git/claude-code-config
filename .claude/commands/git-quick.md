I'll help you with a quick git workflow. Let me:

1. Check current status
2. Show you what's changed
3. Help you stage, commit, and push

First, let me see what's changed:

! git status

! git diff --stat

Based on the changes, I'll help you:
- Stage the appropriate files
- Create a meaningful commit message
- Push to the remote branch

Would you like me to proceed with staging and committing these changes?
